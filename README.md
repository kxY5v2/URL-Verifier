# URL-Verifier
This program takes in a CSV of url's and writes a list of files that either no longer exist or cannot be connected too.
Change the df = pd.read_csv(' ADD YOUR FILE HERE ') to the location of your CSV file.
The program will create the file of broken links for you. Or you can change the output file to the file of your choice.

The file does not check for duplicate entries in the file.
